*Bet on the heartbeat of Etherlink.*

## 🚀 What is ChainChaos?

**ChainChaos** is a fun, weird, and totally unexpected betting game built on **Etherlink**.  
Players place bets on the most unpredictable, quirky metrics of the Etherlink blockchain — like how much gas the chain will burn in the next 5 minutes, how many transactions will fly through in the next 10 blocks, or how long the next streak of empty blocks will be.  

It’s part casino, part chain explorer, part chaos — and 100% fun.  

We believe that every block tells a story — and now you can bet on it.

## 🎯 Why we built this

Blockchains aren’t just about price charts.  
They’re alive, with their own unique rhythm and patterns.  
We wanted to build something that:  

✅ Showcases Etherlink’s performance & accessibility.  
✅ Brings fresh liquidity and users into the ecosystem.  
✅ Makes people pay attention to the inner life of the chain.  
✅ Feels bold, original, and just plain fun.  

So we made ChainChaos — the game where the *chain itself is the game.*

## 🧩 How it works

1️⃣ Players choose from a set of **chaotic metrics** to bet on for the next round.  
2️⃣ They place their stake & submit their guess.  
3️⃣ When the round ends, the smart contract settles based on live chain data.  
4️⃣ Closest guess wins the pot.  

🎉 Examples of weird-but-fair metrics:
- Total gas burned in the next 5 minutes
- Average block time over the next 10 blocks
- Largest single transaction in the round
- Longest streak of empty blocks
- Last digit of cumulative gas at block N

…and more. New chaotic challenges added weekly.

## ⚙️ Tech Highlights

- 🧾 **Smart contracts:**  
  - Fully on-chain betting escrow & settlement.  
  - Transparent & auditable.  
  - Designed for upgradeability.  

- 🔗 **Chain data oracle:**  
  - Fetches real-time Etherlink chain metrics via Golsky.  
  - Transparent reporting: anyone can verify the submitted results.  
  - Centralized for MVP, but upgradeable to decentralized oracles.  

- 🌉 **Cross-chain liquidity:**  
  - Players can bridge assets from other chains via Stargate to participate.  

- 🖥️ **Frontend:**  
  - Simple, fun interface for picking bets & watching rounds play out.  
  - Live leaderboard, round history, and player stats.

## 🌟 The Vision

We see ChainChaos growing into a full-fledged on-chain gaming platform:
- Weekly tournaments
- NFT-based player achievements
- Community-submitted “chaotic metrics”
- Fully decentralized oracle network

But it all starts here — at this hackathon.
